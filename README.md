# guardian
This was a project I completed in the second Semester of my first year at university. The task was to create a project of some kind using p5.js, in the month or so we had to develop it.

Guardian was my submission, a modification of the 1981 Arcade game "Defender". Whilst Defender has a fixed-size map that wraps around, Guardian mimicks an infinitely generating terrain and a scrolling camera by utilising Perlin Noise and a parallax scrolling effect for stars.

I received a First Class grade for it, at 88%, being cited as "approaching professional-level software".
