# guardian

Guadian is a modification of the 1981 Arcade game "Defender". Whilst Defender has a fixed-size map that wraps around, Guardian mimicks an infinitely generating terrain and a scrolling camera by utilising Perlin Noise and a parallax scrolling effect for stars.

This was a project completed in the second semester for the first year of the Computer Science BSc course. The task was to create a project of some kind using p5.js, in the month or so given to develop it.

**I received a First Class grade for it, at 88%, my project being cited as** ***"approaching professional-level software".***
